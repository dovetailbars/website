                    We are now taking bookings for our cocktail masterclasses, which are perfect for groups of friends or colleagues looking for a fun and interactive experience.
                    Our expert mixologists will guide you through the process of making your own cocktails, and you'll get to enjoy the fruits of your labour at the end of the class.
                    Classes are available for groups of up to 10 people, and can be booked for a range of dates and times.
